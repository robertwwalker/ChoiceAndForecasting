    "text": "TLDR: The course is what I think of as the natural successor for Data Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Making that extends basic regression to a broader universe of data types and the particular troubles in forecasting data observed over time.\nIt relies on two texts that exist in both paper and digital [with free access] forms. The first half of the course is built around The Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics: With Examples in R, Python, and Julia by Keith McNulty [Global Director of Talent Sciences at McKinsey and Company] that covers models for discrete data types [binary, ordered, nominal choices, counts of events, and survival/duration analysis].\nThe second half of the course relies on the excellent Forecasting, Principles and Practice, 3rd Edition, by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos of Monash University in Australia that is entirely supported by R libraries for time series problems.\nThe lectures will focus on intuition and the mathematical logic but the goal is to put the tools into practice. To this end, the expectations are weekly homework exercises to insure that we can actually do what we are presented but there are two key summary deliverables: a project employing a detailed application of choice models near the middle and a project in time series forecasting due at the end of the term. Both are to be presented at the end of the term on date to be arranged to make up for the cancellation the first week."

    "text": "An Hypothesis Test\nI will work with the speed variable. The hypothesis to advance is that 17 or greater is the true average speed. The alternative must then be that the average speed is less than 17. Knowing only the sample size, I can figure out what \\(t\\) must be to reject 17 or greater and conclude that the true average must be less with 90% probability. The sample mean would have to be at least qt(0.1, 49) standard errors below 17 to rule out a mean of 17 or greater. Now let’s see what we have. Let me skim the data for the relevant information.\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nskim(cars)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ncars\n\n\nNumber of rows\n50\n\n\nNumber of columns\n2\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n2\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nspeed\n0\n1\n15.40\n5.29\n4\n12\n15\n19\n25\n▂▅▇▇▃\n\n\ndist\n0\n1\n42.98\n25.77\n2\n26\n36\n56\n120\n▅▇▅▂▁\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing the math by hand, I get:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} = \\frac{15.4 - 17}{\\frac{5.29}{\\sqrt{50}}} = -2.14 \\]\nInterpreting the result, the sample mean is 2.14 standard errors below the hypothetical mean of 17. The probability of a sample mean of 15.4 [or smaller] given a true average of 17, this standard deviation and sample size is pt(-2.14, 49) = 0.0186798. Notice that probability is less than 0.1; thus with at least 90% confidence, the true mean is not 17 or greater and thus must be smaller. Assuming the hypothetical mean [17 or greater] is true, the likelihood of generating a sample mean of 15.4 is only 0.0187 and this is far less than the 10% permissible outside of 90% confidence. Indeed, any sample mean more than 1.299 standard errors below 17 would be too small to sustain the belief that the true mean is 17 or greater because qt(0.1, 49) is -1.299. Put in the original metric, any sample mean below 16.0285747 would require a rejection of the claim that the true mean is 17 or greater with 90% confidence."
