The slides [are here.](https://robertwwalker.github.io/xaringan/CMF-Week-7/index.html).

Our seventh class meeting will focus on [Chapter 9](https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/gitbook/survival.html) and [Chapter 11](https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/power-tests.html)  of __Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics__. 

## The Skinny

Two major topics: survival analysis with some discussion of parametric survival analysis and power and study planning.

## Parametric Survival Analysis

Most of this is typically done using the `flexsurv` package in R.  [There is a great post on parametric survival analysis.](https://devinincerti.com/2019/06/18/parametric_survival.html)  We could use AIC/BIC for comparison of the various distributions.
