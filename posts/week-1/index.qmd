```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# url of data set 
url <- "http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv"
# load the data set and store it as a dataframe called salespeople
salespeople <- read.csv(url)
library(GGally)
# convert performance and promotion to categorical
salespeople$promoted <- as.factor(salespeople$promoted)
salespeople$performance <- as.factor(salespeople$performance)
