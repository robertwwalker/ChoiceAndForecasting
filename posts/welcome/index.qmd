I hope you are ready! 

We will work with two books.  

1. For the first half of the course, we will work with the [Handbook of Regression Modelling for People Analytics with Examples in R, Python, and Julia](https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/)   

1. For the second half of the course, we will work with [Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd Edition](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

To hit the ground running, you will probably need two key bits of software: `R` and `RStudio`.  To wit,

- If you prefer something like VSCode or another IDE, that is your choice.  I will heavily utilize `RMarkdown` and `quarto` and both are extensively supported in RStudio.  The most recent version of [RStudio can be obtained here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

- If you wish, the first half of the course can also be completed with either Python or Julia so you can defer `R` for now.  [R can be obtained from this link](https://cran.r-project.org/).  As an R user, I am no expert in Python or Julia and this limits my ability to support those that choose to deploy them.
